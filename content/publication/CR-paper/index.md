abstract: A complete reduction $\phi$ for derivatives in  a differential field $K$ is a linear operator on $K$ that enables us to decompose $f \in K$ as the sum of a derivative and $\phi(f)$. The derivative is unique up to an additive constant, and there exists $\int f \in K$ if and only if $\phi(f)=0$. In this paper, we present a complete reduction for derivatives in a primitive tower algorithmically. Typical examples for primitive towers are differential fields generated by (poly-)logarithmic functions and logarithmic integrals. The in-field integrability is directly determined by $\phi$, and elementary integrability over such towers can be determined by computing parametric logarithmic parts related to $\phi(f)$. Moreover, we discuss how to compute telescopers for non-D-finite functions by the images of $\phi$.
